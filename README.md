# Building
This prototype was build using a practice called [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) - Building a series of related, modular components that can be assembled into pages. 

## Jekyll
The prototype is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static page generator. 

## Sass
To support the atomic design process, the styling for the app is broken up into:
- Tools
- Modules
- Pages
- Vars
